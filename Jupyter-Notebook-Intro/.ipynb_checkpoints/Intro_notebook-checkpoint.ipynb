    "The purpose of this _jupyter_ notebook is to introduce data analysis tools, strategies and terminology used in gamma spectroscopy. The example programming language is _Python3_ , but of course most other coding languages can do the job properly as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have never programmed before or are new to Python and would like to learn more, there are many great Python tutorials available across the web.\n",
    "There even exist plenty of _Open Online Courses_ , e.g.\n",
    "https://www.coursera.org/learn/python. Please have a look around for the one\n",
    "that you like the best. However, note that you do not need to be a\n",
    "Python programmer to pass the lab: the tool and code you will find in this notebook are enough for you to perform your own data analysis!\n",
    "\n",
    "The data analysis for these lab series can roughly be divided into four steps:\n",
    "1. Read experimental data from file.\n",
    "2. Identify peak positions.\n",
    "3. Calibrate the detector response.\n",
    "4. Perform a statistical analysis (e.g. error propagation) and present results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dedicated python library, i.e. a folder with already written code located in\n",
    "`lib`, has been implemented for this data analysis connected to your labs. This library will support you in above mentioned steps 1-3. This introduction notebook will introduce you to these library functions as well as their working principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section will consist of full Python3 coding examples of how to perform the different steps of the data\n",
    "analysis. Every example is finished with a template of how the\n",
    "analysis library can be used to perform the same calculations.\n"

    "- You can **edit** code and text cells by double clicking into them.\n",
    "- You can **run** cells and thus execute code by marking a cell and clicking 'Run' or by pressing `Ctrl-Enter` on your keyboard.\n",
    "- The **output** of the code is printed below cell and can consist of text, graphics or interative elements\n",
    "- The code you run has **'side-effects'** such as **data being modified** or stored in variables. These are kept in memory and work between different cells as Python is running in the background as a so-called Jupyter 'kernel'.\n",
    "- This means that you sometimes have to **consider the order** or the cells you run: later cells might require earlier to have been run or modify data in some way that could lead to surprising results if run twice.\n",
    "- If you want, you can **add cells** from the `Insert` menu.\n",
    "- **Should something not work as expected**:\n",
    "  - Check the error message -- it should give you a good clue what is wrong and maybe that's all you need!\n",
    "  - Make sure that you have run previous cells: they might contain code required for later cells!\n",
    "  - Use 'undo' in the menu to revert to your previous change to the problematic cell (if you modified it at all).\n",
    "  - Try restarting the Python kernel by selecting `Kernel-> Restart Kernel & Clear Output` from the menu. You will not lose any changes but your notebook will 'start over'. Simply execute the cells in order again and see whether the problem persists.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to modify the code, you will be pleased to hear that Jupyter supports \"tab-complete\": if you start typing for example a variable name, you can hit the `Tab` key on your keyboard to let Jupyter complete the name for you and thus save a few keystrokes! Other useful hotkeys are explained in the `Help` menu items."

    "\n",
    "In $\\gamma$-ray (or other radiation) spectroscopy measurements, the goal is usually to determine the energy and the intensity of the radiation. To extract the energy of a given emission line (or use it for calibration puposes), the centroid of a peak must be determined. Area of the peak represents to the intensity of the radiation. A good way to find the peak centroid and area is to fit a Gaussian to the peak. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1 Fitting a Gaussian <a name=\"gaussian\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say that we \"fit\" a function to data, we mean that we are looking for the set of parameters to the function that give the best possible approximation of the data. The algorithm for this usually works iteratively: it starts with some initial guesses for the parameters and then varies in steps. Each time, the (squared) differences to the data are considered; once these are minimized, the algorithm returns the result to the user, typically with some additional statistical information that hints at the quality of the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fit therefore needs four ingredients:\n",
    "1. the data to fit (often a *subset* of the full data set, i.e. the peak region)\n",
    "* a function\n",
    "* initial guesses for its parameters, i.e. a starting point\n",
    "* an algorithm to perform the fit with\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use the algorithm implemented by `curve_fit` from the `scipy.optimize` module for the latter. If you want, you find more detailed information in the [reference documentation to curve_fit](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html). It uses a method called least squares which you can read about in most course literature on statistics and for instance on [Wolfram Alpha](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LeastSquaresFitting.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will fit a Gaussian function. A Gaussian function looks like this:\n",
    "$$G(x) = A\\cdot e^{\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$$\n",
    "where\n",
    "- $A$ is a constant determing the amplitude of the peak, \n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the mean value of the peak (centroid),\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the standard diviation of the peak (width of the peak). \n",
    "\n",
    "Read up on the Gaussian function and its parameters here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code shows how to use the function `curve_fit` to fit a peak in\n",
    "the data that was loaded in the cells above (i.e. _you will need to execute the above code\n",
    "section once before this section will work_).\n",
    "\n",
    "**You might get an error**, if you make a mistake in your initial guesses and the fit does not converge. Just double-check the values and try some others!\n",

We will therefore perform *two* fits: one to the linear background in two regions around the peak as well as a Gaussian fit to the peak *minus* the before derived linear background function. This will noticably improve the quality of the fit. Play with the values and test how stable the result is!"

    "In gamma spectroscopy the area of the peak is determined by the intensity of the gamma ray and the efficiency of the detector. There are different ways of how to calculate the area of a peak in a spectrum. The by far easiest method is to calculate the area of the fitted Gaussian function (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function)). Now that we actually have our Gaussian parameters we can use them for the intensity calculations. "
